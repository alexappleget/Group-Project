        The account was successfully removed. What basically happened was that
        after clicking the button, the system went to the database and told it
        to remove the data associated with the account.

        In case you haven't realized. This is also how companies can add new
        employees onto their system applications. Ever went through training,
        with a company, and recieved a login and temporary password? This is the

        applications.

        A company will oftentimes have a specific admin who will be able to add
        and delete users to keep things extra safe and secure.
