        In case you haven't realized. This is also how companies can add new
        employees onto their system applications. Ever went through training,
        with a company, and recieved a login and temporary password? This is the

        applications.

        A company will oftentimes have a specific admin who will be able to add
        and delete users to keep things extra safe and secure.
